# Reports
A repository for stand-alone reports of relevance to the performance of QCoDeS-driven experiments.

## Background

The perfomance of a scientific experiment depends on many factors, and the control & acquisition sofware is just one of these. In our daily work of optimising and improving experiments, we, the QCoDeS core team, often find ourselves benchmarking things that not actually QCoDeS related, but still of high impact to our experiments. Since these benchmarks are potentially of general interest, we have decided to collect them here and share them with the world.


## Structure

The repository is split on two parts, `instruments` and `technologies`. Under `instruments`, reports about the performance of specific scientific instruments will appear. Under `technologies`, benchmarking of some the stack we rely on can be found.
