# Technologies

The `Technologies` folder is organised like so:

The is a folder for each technology. Inside a folder, each report has its own subfolder. That folder should contain
- A report called `report.rst` containing a description of what was measured and how
- One or more scripts to (re)generate the results
- A `README.md` that describes how to generate the results

A report must be reproducible.
